<h1 style="font-size:4em;">Marginalised Marys</h1>

Marginalised Marys is a research group which focuses on identifying, analysing and constructively critiquing digital content created about nineteenth century women and their writings. In its initial phase this research looks at Anglophone women, but its long term intent is to access and interogate multilingual sources. 

<h2 style="font-size:3em;">This repository</h2>

This repository hosts databases which facilitate commentary on the digital representation of, and access to, collections of Anglophone nineteenth-century women by Marginalised Marys. 

In further project work, the database will be expanded, and will incorporate digital methods to visualise and analyse the current field of digital projects concerning nineteenth-century women. 

<h2 style="font-size:3em;">Project background</h2>

This research emerges from a gap in the scholarship; there is an ongoing need amongst teachers, students, researchers, GLAM employees, and the public alike to access information about nineteenth-century women and their works. This has also been the basis for other projects such as the WWO collection [wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/], the Orlando Project [orlando.cambridge.org], the Poetess Archive [poetessarchive.org] and Digital Schomburg African American Women Writers of the 19th Century [libguides.nypl.org/african-american-women-writers-of-the-19th-Century]. This research is therefore contextualised in an extensive body of digital curation and recent research which aims to recover Anglophone nineteenth-century women through the use of digital tools.

The original research aim was to collect all digital archives related to nineteenth-century women travellers, but after recognising that our method was pertinent to the digital representation and archiving of all women who have left a tangible record, we decided to open our remit to research sites pertaining to any Anglophone woman who was active during the nineteenth century. This inevitably included women who travelled, but also artists, writers, religious figures, working class women, political figures, and socialites.

<h2 style="font-size:3em;">Positionality of researchers</h2>

The researchers are white female-identifying Western academics that are aware that they must situate their privileged position in their scholarship and that they cannot presume to know the site of the archival experience from the position of the oppressed. The research group wish to explore the nuances of digitising and archival history and in doing so acknowledge the work of countless indigenous, subjugated people on whose backs such archives are made. The research group aim to embody within their research an intersectional feminist approach to understand the critical make-up of that which is encountered. Marginalised Marys aims to facilitate a critical nuanced engagement with the process and creation of digital databases, archives, and collections, because they are increasingly becoming a primary investigation tool for professional and public stakeholders alike and thus hold a relatively unacknowledged significance for research and funding.
