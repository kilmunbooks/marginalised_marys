<h1 style="font-size;4em">Research Hypotheses</h1>

In beginning this research we had four <i>zero sum</i> hypothesis

<blockquote><ul>
<li>We hypothesis that women’s writings will be easily searchable.</li> 

<li>We hypothesis that digital archives of women’s writing will be accessible. Of which quality of access is foundationally linked to level of access.</li> 

<li>We hypothesis that, given the recent efforts to negate the gendered bias in archives, digital archives of women’s writing will be free at the point of use.</li>

<li>We hypothesis that we will be unable to discern discrete differences in the form and function of women’s writing archives as with comparable digital archives of male writing.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

The purpose of the research and subsequent analysis is to explore if there are any subtle and/or specific characteristics inherent in archives which digitise, represent, collate, transcribe and critically analyse women’s writing from the long nineteenth century. The information collated notes the size, functionality, and accessibility of identified digital archives, contextualising them within a history of reparative projects concerning nineteenth-century women.
